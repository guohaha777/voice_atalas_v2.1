// Guide-hint port: the association the sound marker says after each choice. Today the answer is the corpus

// same choice is made again. A model-backed provider (sound-hint prompt, closed for now) can implement the same
// interface later — the page won't change. Nothing the child typed (names, places) is part of a request.
