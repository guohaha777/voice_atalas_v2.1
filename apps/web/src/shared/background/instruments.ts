// Instruments for the background layer (万物声场 plays it, 万物成曲 chooses who plays it). An instrument only changes who
// plays the background's notes; with none chosen the notes play in the original soft voice. Each instrument says which
// parts it is for, so several chosen split the work (rules: assignParts in @wanwu-v2/sound-rules/background). The
// list comes from the BackgroundLibrary port (library.ts); today's three browser-synthesised ones are in localInstruments.ts.
