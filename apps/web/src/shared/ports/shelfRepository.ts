// Repository port for 作品书架. The implementation is chosen in app/services.ts — for visitors
// shared/local/shelfRepository.ts (the shelf kept on this device); for signed-in teachers the cloud shelf, filtered by
// account and visibility on the server.
//
// Reading stays synchronous (the page reads a snapshot with useSyncExternalStore): a server adapter keeps the shelf it
// last fetched on this device and `refresh` fetches it again. Changes go to the server, so they return promises.
//
// Intended server endpoints (protocol v0.4; not implemented; sign-in required, the server owns auth and visibility):
//   GET    /api/v1/works?owner=me     → SavedWork[], newest first (each validated with parseSavedWork)   ← refresh
//   GET    /api/v1/works/{workId}     → SavedWork, with its `share` status and link                       ← open
//   PATCH  /api/v1/works/{workId}     ← {title} → SavedWork                                              ← rename
//   DELETE /api/v1/works/{workId}     → 204 (the server keeps nothing the child took off)                ← remove
// Errors come back as {status, reason, message?, requestId}; the adapter turns them into the results below.
