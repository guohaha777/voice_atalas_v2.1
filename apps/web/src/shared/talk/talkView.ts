// 音乐小发现 and 课本讲解 as 万物成曲 shows them (and the prompt lab inspects them). Pure, so the merge rules are
// tested with fake polishers:
// 1. `localTalk`: facts counted by fixed rules, said with the corpus — what is shown at once, without a network;
// 2. `polishTalk`: asks the polisher (if open) with anonymous briefs and keeps only the lines that pass the checks;
// 3. `mergeTalk`: each accepted line replaces its corpus line, with the child's names put back.
